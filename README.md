# Human Activity Recognition
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of 
daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. 
The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
